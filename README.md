## About the project

This is a solution to the [Rock, Paper , Scissors game](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rock-paper-scissors-game-pTgwgvgH). The main challenge is to create the famous game Rock, Paper, Scissors game.

The user'll be able to play the Rock, Paper, Scissors game against the computer however many times he wants. And that is not all; I've created a scoreboard where the user can see how many times he wins against the computer. The score value will be saved on the local storage, which means even if the user leaves the page and comes back later, the previously saved score'll be there yet.

## Built with
